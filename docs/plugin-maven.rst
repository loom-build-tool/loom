Plugin maven
============

This plugin allows Loom to access the repository offered by `Apache Maven`_.


Products
--------

The only user visible product of this Plugin is ``mavenArtifact``. It installs
all Jar products of your project into the local maven repository.

This allows sharing artifacts by Loom for other build tools that can access
the local Maven repository.

The local mavne repository is located at ``~/.m2/repository/`` by default.
This default can be changed by the Maven specific ``settings.xml`` file,
which is located in ``${maven.home}/conf/settings.xml``
or ``${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml``. See `Maven Settings`_ for more details.


Settings
--------

groupAndArtifact
    The *groupId* and *artifactId* used by the ``mavenArtifact`` product when
    creating a ``pom.xml`` and installing to your local repository.
    The format is: ``yourGroupId:yourArtifactId``.
    The also required *version* is specified through the
    ``--artifact-version`` or ``-a`` parameters of the Loom CLI.
